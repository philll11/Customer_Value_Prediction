# Customer Value Prediction
This notebook has been created for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-value-prediction-challenge">Santander Value Prediction<a/> competition on Kaggle. It uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict value. I have implemented some EDA, feature selection and feature engineering in this notebook as well as a GridSearchCV from scratch to select model parameters.
